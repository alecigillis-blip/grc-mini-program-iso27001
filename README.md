# NimbusPay – Mini Compliance Program (ISO 27001 on Azure)

## 📌 Project Summary
This project simulates the foundational work of a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) analyst in building a compliance environment for a fintech SaaS company hosted on **Microsoft Azure**.  
The goal is to design a **mini compliance program** aligned to **ISO 27001 Annex A controls**, assess current maturity, identify gaps, and propose remediation steps.  

The deliverables mirror how organizations prepare for audits and certifications, showcasing practical GRC skills and audit-ready documentation.
